    <h2>Diversity Matters!</h2>
    <p>
        {{ site.title }} is committed to creating a conference that is as inclusive as possible. We want to showcase
        talent available around the world and welcome international submissions as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are also committed to ensuring that the conference is a place where ideas are exchanged, old friends get
        together, new friends meet, and harassment is not tolerated. We expect speakers, attendees and sponsor
        representatives to be professional and courteous to each other. We reserve the right to remove, without refund,
        ANY attendee (speaker or otherwise) who is unable to adhere to this policy.
